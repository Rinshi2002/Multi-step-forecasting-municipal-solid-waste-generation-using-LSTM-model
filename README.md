"# Multi-step-forecasting-municipal-solid-waste-generation-using-LSTM-model" 

Multi-step forecasting in municipal solid waste generation using LSTM-LR Model: Utilized LSTM-LR
models to predict future waste amounts. This approach allowed for accurate predictions over multiple times. Enhanc-
ing the ability to plan and manage municipal waste effectively. The LSTM-LR model demonstrated its proficiency
in capturing temporal dependencies, contributing to more informed decision-making in the context or waste manage-
ment
